        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "This notebook implements the course project solution: a **Hybrid Recommendation System** that leverages Language Model embeddings within the **Cornac** framework.\n",
        "The approach bridges **Graph Neural Networks (LightGCN)** with **Natural Language Processing (BERT)**. We address the \"Cold Start\" problem by calculating semantic similarity between items using an **Autoencoder-compressed BERT** architecture and injecting this knowledge into the Collaborative Filtering graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Scope & Deliverables\n",
        "This work focuses on applied machine learning and fulfills the project requirements via:\n",
        "- **Hybrid Modeling:** Combining ID-based learning with content-based LM features.\n",
        "- **Advanced Architecture:** Custom implementation of `DeepSemanticLightGCN` initialized with semantic weights.\n",
        "- **Comparative Analysis:** Benchmarking against standard Matrix Factorization baseline.\n",
        "- **Required Metrics:** Evaluation is strictly focused on **Recall@10**, **NDCG@10** and **Precision@10**.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to Run\n",
        "1. **Environment:** Google Colab (Recommended) or Jupyter Notebook.\n",
        "2. **Hardware:** **Important:** Select a GPU Runtime (e.g., T4 GPU) to accelerate BERT encoding and GNN training.\n",
        "3. **Execution:** Run all cells sequentially (`Runtime → Run all`).\n",
        "4. **Note:** The \"Semantic Preparation\" step is self-contained but may take a few minutes to encode text data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Expected Outputs\n",
        "Upon execution, the notebook produces:\n",
        "- **Semantic Vector Space:** Compressed text embeddings via the custom Autoencoder.\n",
        "- **Trained Hybrid Model:** The `DeepSemanticLightGCN` with pre-injected weights.\n",
        "- **Comparative Leaderboard:** A table evaluating all models specifically on **Recall@10**, **Precision@10** and **NDCG@10**.\n",
        "- **Visualizations:** Tables summarizing model performance and showing the impact of semantic injection."

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

        "* **Recall@10:** Our hybrid model achieved **0.1711** compared to MF's **0.0385**. This represents a **>340% improvement**.\n",
        "* **NDCG@10:** Ranking quality jumped from **0.0559** to **0.2843**, indicating that the graph architecture is vastly superior at ordering items correctly for the user.\n",
        "* *Interpretation:* MF relies solely on direct user-item interactions, which fail in sparse datasets. The GNN architecture overcomes this by propagating signals through the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Impact of Semantic Injection (Text)\n",
        "Comparing **LightGCN** vs. **LightGCN + Text**, we observe a consistent improvement when adding BERT embeddings:\n",
        "* **Gain:** Recall@10 improved from 0.1692 to **0.1711**, and NDCG@10 from 0.2804 to **0.2843**.\n",
        "* **Significance:** While the numerical gap is smaller than the jump from MF, it validates the hypothesis: initializing the latent space with semantic knowledge (item descriptions) helps the model distinguish items better than ID embeddings alone.\n",
        "* **Cold Start:** This marginal gain suggests that text embeddings effectively \"fill in the gaps\" where pure structural information (interaction graph) is missing or noisy."
